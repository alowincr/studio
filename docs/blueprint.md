# **App Name**: Alonso's Digital Domain

## Core Features:

- Interactive Project Display: Dynamic project showcase with interactive cards, including links to code and live demos, for web applications, e-commerce platforms, and analytical dashboards.
- Animated Skill Showcase: Animated display of technical proficiencies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, MongoDB, Git), each represented with icons and proficiency levels.
- Contact Form with Notifications: Interactive contact form that users can use to send messages directly, with animated notifications for successful submission and errors.
- Dynamic Content Personalization: AI-powered tool to customize portfolio content based on visitor profile for a tailored, personalized user experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4F46E5). This vibrant color will act as a digital interpretation of your system engineering expertise, replacing the original primary color to achieve a better, more modern result.
- Background color: Dark Navy (#1E293B), very close in hue to indigo. Provides a dark and immersive environment for the user to focus on your work, while creating contrast.
- Accent color: Violet (#8B5CF6), used for highlights and interactive elements, in an analogous fashion. This will create a unified, memorable experience with more fine detail than the original.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body. Rationale: this pairing echoes the high-tech spirit of the app's content, and also improves on the user's original choice of only 'Inter' by giving greater visual expression to section headings.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets.
- Crisp, modern icons from Font Awesome to represent technologies, project types, and contact methods. Use a consistent style and size across the site.
- Full-screen sections with clear divisions and ample spacing for readability. Use a grid system for project and skill displays to ensure a responsive layout across devices.
- Subtle animations for transitions, hovers, and loading states. For example, project cards lift on hover, skills fade in, and the loading screen smoothly disappears. Particle animations create an immersive, high-tech feel in the background.
